#pragma mark Returning Objects to pool

/**
 * Returns an object to the pool and takes control of its ownership.
 * Passing an object to this method is
 * equivalent to calling `release` on it, and so you must follow
 * the usual rules of object ownership. You should **never** return an object to
 * a pool if you don't have ownership of it (a retain on it) for the same reason
 * you shouldn't release it if you don't have a retain on it.
 *
 * Another important part of returning an object to a pool is resetting its
 * state. An object that is returned to the pool with a state that hasn't been
 * reset may be given to the user at a different time, causing confusion as
 * the user expects an object with a fresh state. This can lead to memory
 * leaks and crashes which can be difficult to debug.
 *
 * To avoid this confusion, have your pooled objects implement the
 * PXPooledObject protocol, which requires a `reset` method to be
 * implemented. This `reset` method is autuamatically invoked
 * when the object is returned to a PXObjectPool, and should take care of
 * resetting its internal state.
 *
 * If you need to pool objects which you didn't design (and hence can't conform
 * to the PXPooledObject protocol) you must reset their states manually before
 * returning them to the pool.
